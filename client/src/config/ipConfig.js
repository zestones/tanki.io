/**
 * Template for ipConfig.js
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Copy this file and rename it to ipConfig.js
 * 2. Replace YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS with your actual local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
 * 3. The ipConfig.template.js file is gitignored, so your IP address won't be committed to the repository
